# last.fm Account Scraper
Scrapes user data from last.fm using their API by recursively finding users through friends. The program will store all results inside `scraped_data.csv`

## How To Use
1. Open `main.js` and enter your last.fm API key into the `apiKey` variable. Below this line you can also change the root user (a.k.a. the user the program will start scraping from)
2. Run `main.js` via your IDE of choice or the terminal.
3. You can stop the program whenever you want. All results will be stored inside of `scraped_data.csv`
